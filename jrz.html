        <h3>The elderly calico cat with brown hair and white beard</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Garfield, the 18-year-old calico cat, embodies the wisdom of age with her distinguished appearance. Her fur, a patchwork of black, white, and orange, has mellowed over the years, showing the passage of time with grace. </li> .
            <li>Garfield's eyes, once lively, now emanate a serene and knowing gaze, a testament to the experiences she's gathered in her long life. Despite her senior status, Garfield exudes a timeless elegance, a living testament to the beauty of age.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2> My classmate's cat Brul</h2>

        <h3>Brown fuzzy cat</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Brul is a 2yr old Maine coon cat. She prefers to spend his days lying in the bed. She enjoys watching outside from the window as long as there are no loud noises and bugs outside.</li> .
            <li>Brul loves walks on the beach and taking sun naps on a warm summer day. Brul is a playful cat but enjoys having slow, relaxed days at the same time. She hates grooming and bathing.</li>
